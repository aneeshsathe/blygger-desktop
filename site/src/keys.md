# Keyboard shortcuts

Burrow is keyboard-first. Every toolbar button's tooltip shows its key, and
`blygger +list-keybinds` prints this list from the app itself.

**On Windows**, read every ⌘ as **Ctrl** (⌘⏎ is Ctrl+Enter, ⇧⌘, is
Ctrl+Shift+,), with one exception: Versions is Ctrl+Shift+Y, because Ctrl+Y
is Redo there. The app's tooltips, menu and `+list-keybinds` show the Windows
keys.

## The main table

This part is generated from the app's key table
(`crates/blyg-app/src/keymap.rs`), the one that binds the keys and builds the
menus and toolbar buttons.

{{#include generated/keybindings.md}}

## Keys in context

These belong to one screen or sheet, so they aren't in the table above.

| ⏎ | Open the selected post, or start a draft when nothing matches |
| esc | Clear the search; from the editor, back to the omnibar |
| ⌃⌥B | Quick capture, from any app (`capture-hotkey`) |
| ⌘K, or `![[` at the start of a line | Quote a post (threads only) |

**Quick capture and the notes drawer**

|---|---|
| esc, ⌘S | Keep it (a scratch note, or a draft with `capture-default = draft`) |
| ⌘D | Make it a draft on your blyg |
