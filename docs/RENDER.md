# blyg-render: the studio preview renderer

`crates/blyg-render` turns a working copy into the HTML a blyg publishes. It is
a Rust port of the reference Worker's studio preview pipeline. The full editor
(SPEC § "Full editor") shows this HTML in a WebView, so what the author sees is
what readers get.

## Pipeline

```
working copy ─┬─ parse TK scopes (tk.rs, as tk.ts parseScopes), except inside code
              ├─ preview strip: scope → output, or "⚠ ungenerated — <instruction>"
              ├─ annotate: block spans → one-line placeholder token (rendered on its own),
              │            inline spans → U+E001…U+E002 sentinels (Markdown parses across them)
              ├─ [[id]] links → U+E003 tokens, except in code (links.rs)
              ├─ fragment: Markdown                     thread: line walker (transclusion.rs)
              │                                           own-line ![[id]] → Resolver → blockquote,
              │                                             except in code;
              │                                             an attached `>` run → partial quote
              │                                           prose runs → Markdown
              │                                         thread: sanitize (sanitize.rs, lol-html)
              ├─ splice generated blocks, sentinels → span.blyg-tk-gen
              ├─ splice link anchors (or the unresolved marker) for the tokens
              └─ thread: inject the provenance line into each top-level quote
```

The sentinels are Private Use Area characters, as in the Worker since
studio 0.32: block token U+E000, inline U+E001/U+E002, link token U+E003.
Markdown treats them as ordinary text, so linkify, an autolink or a link
destination can take one into a URL. There the percent-encoded marker is
dropped from the `href` (a TK span inside a linkified URL still wraps the
link text, so the Worker emits `<span><a>…</span></a>`; this crate does
too). Sentinels inside a tag (an image `alt`) are dropped. Blocks are
spliced in literally (a `$&` in generated text stays `$&`).

"Code" is the Worker's `codeRanges` (`markdown::code_ranges`): code blocks
(fenced or indented, at any depth) as markdown-it's block parser maps them,
plus code spans (a run of N backticks to the next run of exactly N, never
across a blank line). Inside code, `[TK]`, `![[id]]` and `[[id]]` are
inert text (studio#3, #4). The thread walker leaves a line as prose when
its start lies in code. A directive on its own line inside TK output is a
real quote: upstream took that reading provisionally (v0.4-plan §9.2), so a
multi-line inline scope holding `![[id]]` splits its `span` around the
quote, as the Worker's does (`tr_inline_tk_multiline_directive`).

**`impyrt` scopes** (decision #37): `[TK]impyrt=<pasted text>[/TK]` or
`[TK]impyrt <model>=…[/TK]` (also with `[=]`; the keyword is
case-insensitive) mark text generated elsewhere. The instruction reads
`impyrt`, the output is the text after the first `=`, `TkScope::imported`
carries the model, and no sources are declared.

**Sanitizing** (studio 0.32). The Worker's thread preview runs its
allowlist sanitizer (`importer/sanitize.ts`) over the walked HTML before the
TK and link splices; its public pages run it over a thread's baked HTML, so
this is what readers see. `sanitize.rs` ports it on lol-html, the library
HTMLRewriter is built on, so untouched markup keeps its bytes. Listed tags
keep listed attributes (`alt class title width height colspan rowspan
scope datetime open dir lang`), `data-blyg-*`, an `<a href>` that is
http(s), mailto or tel, and an `<img src>` that is http(s). Scripts,
styles, iframes, SVG, forms and the like go with their content; other
unknown tags are unwrapped. So a thread preview loses table alignment,
`<ol start>`, `referrerpolicy`/`loading` on images, and the YouTube
facade's `data-ytid` and `aria-label` (the poster link still works).
Fragments are not sanitized, in the Worker or here.

**Partial quotes** (spec §16.4, ported from blygger-studio 0.8.3's
`transclusion.ts`). A `![[id]]` line followed directly (no blank line) by a
run of `>` lines quotes a passage instead of the whole item. The run ends at
the first line that is not a quote line, and it belongs to the directive
even when the target does not resolve. A blank line detaches it: that is a
whole quote followed by the author's own blockquote, as before. The
selection is the run's Markdown (each line stripped of `>` and one
whitespace character), rendered and flattened by `selection_text`: block
boundaries become `\n`, whitespace inside a block collapses, empty blocks
drop. It must be a substring of the `selection_text` of the target's
`content_html`. If it is, the bake is `blockquote.blyg-transclusion.blyg-partial`
(same `data-blyg-*` attributes) holding the selection's escaped plain text,
one `<p>` per line, and the quote's `Quote::selector` carries the wire's
`selector` (`exact`, plus up to 32 UTF-16 units of `prefix`/`suffix`).
Otherwise the unresolved marker shows "the attached blockquote is empty" or
"quoted passage not found in the target's version N". The provenance line
of a partial quote reads "excerpt of vN". Provenance injection matches the
`blyg-transclusion` class token (skipping `unresolved`), so a partial quote
keeps later lines paired with their quotes.

**`[[id]]` links** (protocol 0.3 §16.2) work in both kinds (`links.rs`, the
Worker's `resolveInternalLinks` / `previewInternalLinks` /
`applyInternalLinks`). A link is inline and bakes nothing: no
`transclusions[]` entry, no mention, no self or cycle check. It resolves
through the same `Resolver` as a quote (`Resolver::resolve_link`, which
defaults to `resolve`) and becomes `<a href="…">“excerpt”</a>`, where the
excerpt is the first 60 UTF-16 units of the target's text (else "a thread"
or "a fragment"). Your own items link to `{mount}/{f|t}/{id}/`, imported ones
to their origin's `page` or `{origin}{f|t}/{id}/`. An unresolved link shows
`span.blyg-link-unresolved` and joins `Stats::unresolved` after the quotes,
with `directive` `[[id]]`; publish refuses it ("one or more references do not
resolve"). A link in code (`codeRanges`; in a generated block's rendered
HTML, any `<code>…</code>`) is literal text and never resolved. Every
other link is resolved and reported, then spliced only where an anchor can
go (`applyInternalLinks`, studio#13): inside a tag (an image's alt) or a
URL it is the author's literal `[[id]]` (percent-encoded in an `href`);
inside another link's text it is the anchor's label, or the literal when
that link's URL carries it (an autolink). `native_blocks` turns links into `Span { item: Some(id), .. }` for
the stream to label; its grammar is looser (either case), like its
directive grammar.

A line map follows every rewrite (`linemap.rs`), so each top-level block can
carry `data-line="N"` (0-based source line) for source ↔ preview jumping.

## Markdown engine: markdown-it.rs, not comrak or pulldown-cmark

The Worker runs markdown-it 14 with `{ html: false, linkify: true,
typographer: false }` plus its embeds plugin. I rendered the first corpus
(56 plain-Markdown cases) through each candidate, stock:

| crate | matches the Worker | why it misses |
|---|---|---|
| `markdown-it` 0.6 (a port of markdown-it.js) | 42/56 | only linkify, the embeds plugin and alt text |
| `comrak` 0.55 | 34/56 | XHTML `<br />`, table `align=`, escaped HTML not wrapped in `<p>`, unsafe links become `href=""`, GFM autolink rules |
| `pulldown-cmark` 0.13 | 22/56 | no linkify at all, plus the same structural differences |

markdown-it.rs shares markdown-it's token model and renderer conventions, so
the remaining gaps were ones this crate has to fill anyway. These pieces are
replaced to match the JavaScript library exactly:

- **Link normalisation** (`normalizeLink`, `normalizeLinkText`): mdurl
  parse/format, punycode hosts (`punycode.rs`, same behaviour as punycode.js),
  mdurl encode and decode.
- **Linkify** (`linkify.rs`): a port of linkify-it 5, using its own regular
  expressions on `fancy-regex`, with both of markdown-it 14's rules (the
  inline `scheme://` rule and the core fuzzy-link and email rule).
- **Emphasis** (`emph.rs`): markdown-it.rs's `emph_pair` with CommonMark 0.31
  delimiter classification, where Unicode symbols count as punctuation.
- **Rendering details**: image `alt` text (the Worker's `altText`, studio#6:
  text, escapes, entities and inline code), line
  breaks around code blocks, list items and empty blockquotes, and no final
  `\n` in a fence left open at the end of a document without one.
- **Embeds**: the YouTube facade (`figure.blyg-yt`, byte-identical to
  embeds.ts) and `referrerpolicy="no-referrer"` on off-origin images.

Raw HTML is never passed through: `html: false` escapes it.

```

- **Resolver.** It resolves from the local store only: your published items
  first, then imported blyg items (the Worker's `resolveTarget` order).
  `Found.origin` is `None` for your own items. `author` is the source blyg's
  display name, which the provenance line prints as "from *name*". The
  renderer itself flags a thread quoting itself (`self_id`) and `@vN`
  directives. Circular quotes need the store's closure, so the resolver
  reports them as `Unavailable(Circular)`.
- **Unresolved quotes.** The marker shows the Worker's exact reason string
  (`Display`). `UnresolvedReason::human()` gives a plain sentence for the
  status bar.
- **Line map.** `line_map` lists `(source_line, block_index)` for each
  `[data-line]` element, in document order. Nested blocks carry no line.
- **Page shell.** Its CSP is `default-src 'none'`, images from anywhere,
  `frame-src` limited to youtube-nocookie.com, and `script-src` limited to one
  nonce, used only by our own script (click-to-play and the failed-image
  link). Content has no nonce, so no script from content runs: inline
  handlers and `javascript:` URLs are blocked too. Theme CSS cannot close its
  `<style>` early. Links opening in the default browser is the host WebView's
  job.
- **Attachments.** Public pages append, after `.item-content`, each attached
  image the content does not already show (studio#24: not `inline`, and its
  key not in `content_html`). They are live rows, not part of the Markdown,
  so the host renders them with `preview_media` next to `Rendered.html`.

## Parity

`tests/fixtures/gen_parity.mjs` bundles `tests/fixtures/gen_parity_worker.js`
with the Worker's own `markdown.ts`, `embeds.ts`, `tk.ts`, `authoring.ts`,
`transclusion.ts`, `importer/sanitize.ts` and `pages.ts`, using the Worker's
esbuild, and runs the bundle in workerd through the Worker's own Miniflare
(the sanitizer is built on workerd's HTMLRewriter, which Node lacks). The
harness is the body of `read-api.ts`'s `POST /api/preview` handler and
`threadPreview()`, called with a fake D1 that serves `fake_store.json`;
`tests/common` implements the same store as a Rust `Resolver`. It writes the
expected HTML to `tests/fixtures/parity/`. The fixtures are committed, so CI
never needs the Worker. Nothing in the Worker directory is modified, and
nothing is written unless every case rendered.

```sh
# after editing corpus.json, fake_store.json or media_input.json, or when
# the Worker changes (the Worker package needs `npm ci` first)
node crates/blyg-render/tests/fixtures/gen_parity.mjs /path/to/worker/package
cargo test -p blyg-render
```

**Reference version.** The fixtures come from the reference Worker on
blygger-studio 0.32.1 plus upstream PR #35, re-generated 2026-10-06
(`parity/_manifest.json` records the studio, markdown-it and linkify-it
versions). The Worker's preview helpers moved again in 0.32
(`previewLinkDocs`/`spliceLinkDocs` became `previewInternalLinks`,
`resolveBlockLinks` and `applyInternalLinks`), so the generator now calls the
handler's own sequence instead of a copy of it.

Against the previous fixtures (studio 0.11 with local patches), 18 of 191
corpus cases changed and this crate followed every one:

- TK sentinels are U+E000–E002 and the link token U+E003, not C0 controls,
  so a marker can sit inside a link destination, an autolink or a linkified
  URL (`tk_sentinel_*`).
- `[TK]` inside code is not a scope (`tk_in_code_span`, `tk_indented_block*`,
  `tk_block_in_fence*`, `tk_inline_in_indented_code`).
- A directive on its own line in TK output is a quote
  (`tr_inline_tk_multiline_directive`, `tr_ungenerated_tk_with_directive`).
- `[[id]]` is resolved everywhere outside code and spliced as text, literal
  or anchor by where it landed (`link_in_attrs`, `link_autolink_literal`,
  `link_in_link_text_unresolved`).
- Image alt text keeps inline code (`image_alt_markup`,
  `images_alt_escapes_link`).
- The thread preview is sanitized (`mixed_document`).

The patch 9 and patch 12 behaviours this crate used to reproduce are gone
where upstream fixed the same bugs differently; nothing emulates a Worker
bug that the Worker no longer has. 11 corpus cases were added for `impyrt`
scopes, the sanitizer (a hostile quoted target, Markdown that loses
attributes, a sanitized TK block) and TK or links in code, plus a media
case for placed and `inline` attachments.

Results. Tests compare after collapsing whitespace between tags, but every
case is also byte-identical:

| suite | cases | normalised | byte-identical |
|---|---|---|---|
| corpus (paragraphs, emphasis, links, linkify edges, headings, lists, code, quotes, images, raw HTML, YouTube, TK, `impyrt`, transclusion, partial quotes, `[[id]]` links, sanitizing) | 202 | 202 | 202 |
| CommonMark 0.31.2 spec examples | 652 | 652 | 652 |
| linkify-it + markdown-it linkify test vectors | 206 | 206 | 206 |
| attachments (`mediaHtml`) | 4 | 4 | 4 |

**Pending: studio 0.32.2.** The Worker will re-sync to upstream 0.32.2,
which changes `tk.ts`. When it does, re-run the generator and follow the
fixtures that change.

**Partial quotes** match the Worker byte for byte in all 11 `tr_partial_*`
cases: found, emphasis in the quote, paragraph breaks, text inside a nested
quote, not found, empty, detached by a blank line, a remote target, an
unknown target (the run is still consumed), partial then whole (provenance
pairing), and loose `>` markers. Unit tests ported from the studio's
`selection.test.ts` and `partial-transclusion.test.ts` cover the normalizer
and selector context as well.

**Provenance on the preview is the desktop's own combination.** The Worker's
previews (`POST /api/preview`, the thread editor) show no provenance.
`injectProvenance` only ever runs on published HTML, which can't hold an
unresolved marker. The generator composes the preview with the page's
`injectProvenance`, as this crate does, and hides unresolved markers from it,
as they would be absent on the page.

Every fixture also checks the unresolved directives and reasons, in order,
and the TK error count against the Worker; thread fixtures also check the
resolved quote ids. `tests/preview.rs` adds checks that need no Worker:

- Turning `data-line` on changes nothing but the attributes, for every
  fixture and for 1,500 fuzzed documents built from the grammar's sharp
  edges. The fuzz run also checks that nothing panics and that no TK marker
  reaches the output.
- The stats, the self-quote check, CRLF handling, the page shell, and that
  content can never inject markup.

### Worker behaviour pinned as it is

These look like upstream bugs, and the fixtures pin them because readers get
them too:

- A TK span around a URL that linkify takes closes inside the link:
  `<span class="blyg-tk-gen"><a …>…</span></a>` (`tk_sentinel_in_url`).
- A marker glued to an email or `www.` host stops linkify from taking it
  (`tk_sentinel_after_email`).
- A multi-line inline scope holding an own-line `![[id]]` puts the quote
  inside the scope's `span`, across paragraphs
  (`tr_inline_tk_multiline_directive`).

### Deliberate differences (outside the fixtures' reach, or safer)

- **Leftover markers.** A block token Markdown did not leave in a paragraph
  of its own becomes the span's escaped text, and any other U+E000–E002 is
  stripped, so no marker ships. The Worker leaves them in; this also strips
  those characters when an author types them.
- **`data-line`.** The sanitizer keeps it; it is the desktop preview's own
  attribute, and the Worker's preview has none.
- **Attachment `src`.** It is HTML-escaped; the Worker interpolates it raw.
  They differ only if the mount or a media key contains `& < > " '`. (The
  provenance `href` goes through `escapeHref` in both: http(s) or mailto,
  else `#`.)
- **Line endings.** CRLF and CR are normalised to LF before rendering. The
  Worker receives LF from browsers.
- **Remote provenance label.** It uses the origin's host, lower-cased with the
  default port dropped, where the Worker uses `new URL(origin).host`. That
  also punycodes the host, which this crate does not.
- **Citation dates.** They use the ISO date part, where the Worker uses
  `toLocaleDateString` in the server's time zone.
- **Preview script.** It gives the iframe a `referrerpolicy`, since YouTube
  embeds need a referrer. It resolves image URLs against `document.baseURI`,
  so the fallback works on a non-http preview origin. It also re-checks
  images after DOM patches.
- **Sanitizer URL check.** Entities are decoded with `html-escape` and URLs
  resolved with the `url` crate, where the Worker uses `entities`'
  `decodeHTMLAttribute` and WHATWG `URL`. They can differ on legacy entities
  without a semicolon and on malformed URLs.
- **Unicode data.** `\p{P}`, `\p{S}`, `\p{Z}` come from Rust's Unicode tables,
  not uc.micro's. linkify-it's length caps count UTF-16 units in JavaScript
  and code points here. Both matter only at the edges: newly assigned code
  points, or astral-plane labels near 63 characters.

## Performance

`tests/bench.rs` renders a 20,400-character mixed thread. It has quotes,
unresolved quotes, TK, links, fuzzy links, lists, tables, code and videos.

- Release: 4.2 ms median, 4.6 ms worst, against a 10 ms budget. Keeping
  code lines from transcluding costs about 0.3 ms: a thread containing
  `![[` gets one extra block-only parse (`markdown::code_lines`).
- Debug: about 20 ms.

A second test runs 11 adversarial inputs aimed at the linkify regexes'
backtracking. Each takes 1–10 ms in release.

```sh
cargo test -p blyg-render --release --test bench -- --nocapture
```
