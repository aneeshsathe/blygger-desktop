# Burrow — spec

Burrow is a blygger client (called Blygger Desktop up to 0.6.0; only the
displayed name changed, see "Naming" below). A native macOS client for a Blygger blog ("blyg") running the Blygger reference
Worker plus the owner-API extensions in `docs/SERVER.md`. Goal: **zero
friction between a thought and a published post.** The feel target is
Notational Velocity: one window, type to search, ⏎ to create, nothing ever
waits on the network.

The agreed interaction design is the clickable mock in `docs/prototype/index.html`
(open it in a browser, and play the ▶ demos). When this document and the mock
disagree on *feel*, follow the mock. On *API behaviour*, this document wins.

## Decisions (settled)

| Area | Decision |
|---|---|
| UI | **GPUI** (Zed's framework) + `gpui-component` where it helps (text input/editor). |
| Local data | **SQLite** via `rusqlite` (`bundled`, FTS5). Local-first: UI reads only from SQLite. DuckDB was considered and declined because this is an OLTP/tiny-write workload, and DuckDB can read the SQLite file later for analytics. |
| Network | Blocking HTTP (`ureq`, rustls) on background threads. No tokio in the app. |
| Auth | Base URL + a bearer: **Sign in with browser** (OAuth, PKCE, loopback redirect; studio 0.28+; the default), else an API token (Studio → More → Client access, or a fork's `BLYG_OWNER_TOKEN`), else the studio password. Credentials live in the **macOS Keychain** (Windows Credential Manager on Windows; `keyring` crate), never in a file. See `crates/blyg-core/src/api/oauth.rs`. |
| Platform | macOS first; Windows (x64) is supported too, from the same code: platform code sits behind `cfg(target_os = …)`, mostly in `crates/blyg-app/src/platform.rs`, and the Windows build must keep building and passing CI (see `site/src/dev/building.md`, "Keeping Windows building"). |
| Layout | **Side by side**: item list on the left (~38%), editor on the right. |
| Theme | **Tufte colours** (paper `#fffff8`, ink `#111`, accent `#a4271b`; dark: `#161513` / `#e4dfd3` / `#e0775a`), follows system light/dark. Default in the mock was dark. |
| Fonts | ET Book reads poorly on screen per the user. **Fonts are user-switchable in the app** (separate choices for writing font and UI font) with screen-first defaults: writing = **Literata** (bundled, OFL), UI/list = **Inter** (bundled, OFL). Offer at least: Literata, Source Serif 4, iA Writer Quattro (bundled, OFL); system New York, Charter, SF Pro, Menlo; ET Book stays available as an option. Size adjustable (⌘+ / ⌘−). |
| Quick capture | Global hotkey, default **⌃⌥B**, **configurable** in settings. |
| Scope | Everything in §Scope is in v1. |

## Interaction spec (main window)

- **Omnibar** at top, always there. Typing filters the list live (substring,
  case-insensitive, matched text highlighted). `↑/↓` move the selection, and the
  editor previews the selected item as you move (NV behaviour).
  `⏎` opens the selection; **`⏎` with no matches creates a draft seeded with the
  query** and puts the caret at the end of it. `esc` clears the query.
- **Editor**: plain Markdown text, no toolbar. Every keystroke saves locally;
  push to the server ~800 ms after typing stops. There is no save button.
- **Status bar** (bottom): `◦ fragment` / `≡ thread` (clickable, toggles),
  counter `214 / 1000` (amber >900, red >1000, for fragments only; threads show
  "N chars · no limit"), a centre banner when over the limit ("Too long for a
  fragment · ⌘T makes it a thread"), sync state (`synced` / `saved on this Mac`
  / `syncing…` / `offline · N changes waiting`), version (`draft` / `public v3`
  / `public v3 · unpublished edits`).
- **List rows**: title (first line), then `◦ fragment`/`≡ thread`, a status pill
  (`draft` or `vN`), a dot for unpublished edits, and relative time.
- **New post** (`⌘N`, Post › New Post): opens a fresh, empty editor with the caret
  in it, without touching the omnibar: its text, the list's filter and its
  scroll stay as they were. No row shows as selected while the new post isn't
  in the list (it's selected once it's listed); ↑/↓ go on from the row selected
  before ⌘N, which opens that post and leaves the new one. Nothing exists until the first real keystroke,
  which creates a local scratch note (`Backend::create_scratch`; a draft with
  `new-note = draft`) that then autosaves like any edit. `⌘D` makes it a draft
  (same local id), `⌘⏎` publishes it through the publish sheet. Leaving it while
  it's empty (another post, a search, `⌘N` again) deletes it, so there are no
  blank items. While it's open the status bar says "New note · saved locally ·
  ⌘D draft · ⌘⏎ publish" ("New draft · syncs to your blyg · ⌘⏎ publish" with
  `new-note = draft`). The omnibar's create (`⏎` with no match) is unchanged.
  Code: `crates/blyg-app/src/new_post.rs`.
- **Keys**: `⌘L` focus omnibar · `⌘N` new post · `esc` (in editor) back to omnibar ·
  `⌘⏎` publish · `⌘T` fragment⇄thread · `⌘E` preview (see § Full editor) · `⌘O` open
  permalink in browser · `⌘,` settings · `⌘+/⌘−` font size · `⇧⌘⌫` delete a
  draft or scratch note.
- **Delete / Withdraw** (rule 5 below): `⇧⌘⌫` (Post › Delete Draft…) on a draft
  or scratch note drops a sheet: "Delete this draft? … This can't be undone."
  `⏎` deletes, `esc` cancels; the list moves on to the next post and a toast
  says "Draft deleted". Published posts are never deleted: `⇧⌘⌫` on one says
  so, and Post › Withdraw… asks instead, with an optional note ("Withdrawn
  posts stay listed as withdrawn. You can't undo this."), then calls
  `withdraw(id, note)`. Withdraw has no key on purpose, since it's permanent.
  (`⌘⌫` stays delete-to-line-start in the editor.)
- **Publish** (`⌘⏎`): a sheet drops from the title bar: "Publish "…" as vN+1",
  with an optional version note input. `⏎` publishes and `esc` cancels. If the
  item is a fragment over 1000 chars, don't open the sheet: shake the status bar
  and say ⌘T. A toast shows the result: "Published v2 · blyg.example.com/f/… · ⌘O opens it".
- **Paste a link over selected text** (as WordPress does): when the selection
  is on one line and the clipboard holds only a web or `mailto:` address, ⌘V
  makes it `[text](url)` (brackets escaped, `<…>` around an address with
  parentheses; spaces caught in the selection stay outside). An address or an
  existing link that's selected is simply replaced. One undo step.
- **@-mentions** (editor and quick capture): typing `@` at the start of a word
  opens a small popup under it, filtered as you type, of the blygs you know
  (subscriptions, blogrolls, authors in your reading, profiles already fetched;
  matched on author name, site title and host; recently read and quoted ones
  first). `↑/↓` choose, `⏎`/`⇥` insert, esc closes it and keeps the typed text.
  Not in code or on a paste. There's no identity layer (rule 6), so the pick is
  a plain link, `[Author or title or host](https://blyg.example.org/)`, and
  nothing else: a plain link notifies nobody.
- **Spellcheck** (`spellcheck = true`, Edit › Spelling › Check Spelling While
  Typing): the macOS spell checker (system languages, learned words), a red
  wavy underline, and a menu on right-click/ctrl-click with suggestions, Learn
  Spelling and Ignore. Code, links and their targets, addresses, `![[id]]`, the
  TK markers and front matter are skipped. It runs ~300 ms after typing stops,
  only on changed lines, off the UI thread; typing never waits on it.
- **Paste/drop an image**: this inserts `![uploading…]()` at the caret, uploads
  via `POST /api/media` (without `item_id`), then replaces the placeholder with
  `![](<blyg origin>/media/<id>.<ext>)`. Two Worker behaviours decide this: public
  pages append every *attachment* (media with the item's id) after the text, so
  an attached image that's also inline shows twice; and a relative `media/…` in
  the text renders page-relative, which 404s under `/f/<id>/`. If the placeholder
  is gone by the time the upload finishes, the file is deleted again
  (`DELETE /api/media/:id`).
- **Conflict** (the server changed since the last sync and there are local edits):
  a sheet with a side-by-side view "On this Mac" vs "On the server", with keys `1`
  keep mine / `2` take the server's / `3` keep both.
- **Offline**: nothing blocks. The status shows the queued count, and the queue
  flushes when the network is back.
- **Quick capture**: the global hotkey shows a small floating panel over any
  app, containing a text area and a fragment counter. `esc` keeps it as a local
  scratch note (see § Scratch notes), `⌘D` saves a draft, `⌘⏎` publishes.

## Scope (v1, all in)

Writing: fragments & threads, autosave, publish with note, paste/drop images,
quick capture, markdown preview, withdraw, version history + restore, pin
(irrevocable, so it confirms), delete drafts, quote another blyg (picker, ⌘K or typing `![[`, that
inserts `![[<id>]]`), fork.
Reading & managing: open on the web, read subscriptions (reading list), subscribe
and unsubscribe, blogroll flag, blyg settings (title, bio, links), mentions &
responses.

Phase 1 (parallel agents): core crate, writing UI, and Worker read endpoints.
Phase 2: reading/management UI, quote picker, fork, settings UI.

## Architecture

```
crates/blyg-core   model.rs (types) · backend.rs (Backend trait, the UI seam)
                   api/  (ureq client, one fn per endpoint, typed errors)
                   store/ (rusqlite: items, versions cache, outbox, reading, subs, FTS5)
                   sync/ (worker thread: debounce, outbox flush, periodic pull, conflicts)
                   live.rs (LiveBackend: impl Backend over store+api+sync)
crates/blyg-app    GPUI app. Talks only to `Arc<dyn Backend>`. Contains a
                   FakeBackend (in-memory, seeded) so the UI runs with no server:
                   `BLYGGER_FAKE=1 cargo run`.
```

The `Backend` trait and the model types in `blyg-core/src/{backend,model}.rs`
are the contract. Changing them is the orchestrator's call. An agent who needs
a change says so in its final report and doesn't make it unilaterally.
(Adding *private* helpers is fine.)

Configuration: one Ghostty-style plain-text file, `~/.config/blygger/config` (list every key with
`blygger +show-config --default --docs`). Secrets live in the Keychain. App state (SQLite db, caches,
media) lives in `~/Library/Application Support/org.blygger.desktop/`.

## API (owner, bearer auth)

Base: the configured `blyg-url` for public pages and the studio; `/api` is host-rooted (a
blyg at `https://host/blyg` has its API at `https://host/api`). Every `/api` call carries
either `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (a browser sign-in's access token, a manual API token, or a fork's extension-1 owner token) or the studio session
cookie `blyg_session`, from `POST {blyg-url}/studio/login` (form field `password`; a 302
with `Set-Cookie`; 30 days). JSON bodies are sent with `content-type: application/json`.
Failure `401 {"error":"unauthorized"}`. Error bodies are `{error, errors?, issues?}`
(`issues: [{path, message}]` on validation failures). A wrong method is `405`.

The authoritative contract is upstream blygger-studio's OpenAPI document
(`openapi.json`, studio 0.32.1; vendored as `crates/blyg-core/tests/fixtures/openapi.json`,
and the test mock checks all traffic against it). Its route guide is `docs/api.md` in
https://github.com/blygger/blygger-studio. Bearer auth and the other extensions this app
uses are in `docs/SERVER.md`. The key points:

- Collections (`GET /api/items`, `/subscriptions`, `/hoppers`, `/mentions`) →
  `{items, total, offset, limit}`; page with `offset`/`limit` (at most 100).
- Item = `{id, kind, status, version, dirty, created, updated, content_md, responses,
  provenance, stub_of, forked_from, fork_cite}`. No permalink: the app derives
  `{blyg-url}/f|t/{id}`. `responses` is `"default" | "show" | "hide"`; `default`
  follows settings' `show_responses_default`.
- `GET /api/items/:id` → Item + `authored_kind`, `media`, `published` and
  `versions: Version[]` (a withdraw marker is `kind: "withdrawn"`).
- `POST /api/items {mode: "blank", kind, content_md, stub_of?}` → `201 Item`.
  `{mode: "fork", source: {origin, id, version}}` forks a pinned version.
- `PATCH /api/items/:id {content_md?, kind?, stub_of?, responses?}` → Item. Unknown
  fields are a 400. Kind changes until the first publish (409 after).
- `POST /api/items/:id/publish {note?}` → `{ok, version, warning?}`; 400 on over-limit / bad transclusion
- `POST /api/items/:id/withdraw {note?}`, `POST …/restore {version}`, `DELETE /api/items/:id` (drafts only)
- `PUT /api/items/:id/versions/:version/pin` (no body) → `{ok, version, already}`
- `POST /api/media` multipart `file` (+`item_id`, `alt`) → `201 {id, url, mime}`
- `PATCH /api/mentions/:id {hidden}`, `PUT/DELETE /api/signals/:sub/:remoteId {thumb}`
- Subscriptions: `GET/POST /api/subscriptions`, `PATCH /api/subscriptions/:id
  {in_blogroll?, title?, paused?}`, `DELETE …`, `POST …/resync` → `{ok, changed: n}`
- `GET /api/settings`, `PATCH /api/settings {...}` (booleans are booleans)
- `GET /api/mentions?direction=inbound` (`source_author_json` is a JSON string)
- `GET /api/hoppers/:id?preview=true` → `{hopper, memberships, items, total, source_count}`

**Reading** (extension 3, see `docs/SERVER.md`; not upstream):

- `GET /api/reading/imported?limit=N&before=<cursor>` → `{items: ReadingItem[], next: string|null, read_state}`,
  imported items newest `observed_at` first; the default limit is 100 and the max is 500. `next` is an **opaque cursor**:
  pass it back as `before` verbatim. Pages are ≤ limit. `page` is origin-relative (resolve it against `origin`).
  ReadingItem =
  `{subscription_id, remote_id, subscription_title, origin, kind, state, version,
  created, updated, observed_at, content_md, content_html, author: {name,url}|null,
  page, thumb: 1|-1|null, hoppers: string[], read_version, pinned_version_retained,
  transclusions}`. `content_html` is raw: sanitize before display. Upstream's own
  `/api/reading` returns rendered `ReadingEntry` rows with `offset`/`limit` paging
  (at most 50) instead.

**Read-state sync** (optional extension 5, see `docs/SERVER.md`): `GET /api/reading/imported` adds
`read_state: true` and a per-item `read_version: number|null`;
`PUT /api/reading/:sub/:remoteId/read {version}` and
`POST /api/reading/read {items: [{sub, remote_id, version}]}` (≤ 500) store
`max(existing, version)`. On blygger-studio 0.39+ the read-state writes need the scope
`reading:state` (a provisional name; `oauth::READ_STATE_SCOPE`), not `owner:manage`.

Transclusion syntax is `![[<26-char id>]]` alone on its own line, and is only
valid in threads. See upstream `worker/src/transclusion.ts` for which ids resolve
(local and/or imported).

## Safety

- **Never write to the production blyg while developing.** Test against a mock
  HTTP server (core) or a local `wrangler dev` of a patched reference Worker (integration).
  The first real publish belongs to the user.
- Never log or print the token.

## Reading

**One entry per post, however many times it's edited.** An edit updates the existing row (the "edited · vN" badge plus a diff since you last read it) and never creates a new unread item. Cross-subscription duplicates (someone's blyg + their RSS feed) collapse to one row, preferring the blyg row. RSS items whose id changes on edit are matched by their resolved page URL. Tombstones are hidden unless signalled or hoppered. The mock is at `docs/prototype/ai-and-reading.html` §5.

**The stream is the default reading view** (`reading/stream.rs`, issue #1). A Stream | Reader toggle heads the reading screen (⌥⌘1 / ⌥⌘2, remembered in `state.json` as `reading_mode`). Stream: one native GPUI timeline in a virtualized `list`, newest first, drawn from each post's Markdown (`blyg_render::native_blocks`, the same markdown-it engine; no WebView per post). Each post shows its author and blyg, date, kind and the lineage line (↳ stub of / ⑂ forked from); fragments show in full, threads their title, about four lines and "Read more". A `![[id]]` is a grey quote box with the quoted text when it's held here, else the excerpt the quoting blyg cited (`transclusions[].cited`, protocol 0.3), else a note that it isn't held. An inline `[[id]]` link (protocol 0.3 §16.2) reads as the held target's excerpt in quotes, as the published page's anchor does (else "linked post"), and opens the post like a quote box. Images, embeds and tables are compact placeholders. j/k (↑/↓) select, and the selected post shows the actions (Read more, Quote into a thread, Reply · new stub, AI reply, Link post, Open on web, thumbs). ⏎, Space or "Read more" open the post in a side pane (the sanitized WebView reader with its pill and actions); j/k then move the pane along; esc closes it and the stream keeps its place. A post is read once it has been at least half on screen (or filled half the screen) for one second while the window is active (`stream_vm::ReadTracker`, `Backend::mark_read`); a post opened in the pane is read too. Unread posts get a dot, never a count. The search filters the stream as it filters the list. Reader is the list + post layout below.

**Reader is three panes, NetNewsWire style** (`reading/sources.rs`, `sources_vm.rs`): sources | posts | the post. The sources pane lists smart feeds (All unread: never read or edited since you read it; Today: the post's own date, local time; Thumbed: 👍; All, the default), then the user's **folders** with their subscriptions, then the subscriptions in no folder. Each subscription shows its name (or host) with its cached profile avatar, else a letter badge, and a dot when something is unread; smart feeds and folders show a muted unread count (reader-local, private: allowed by rule 1). Picking a source filters the list (the search is scoped to it); a post read in a source stays listed until the source changes. **Folders are local only**: the store's `folders` / `folder_members` tables (schema v7), one folder per subscription, never sent to the blyg and not the server's hoppers (`Backend::folders`, `subscription_folders`, `create_folder`, `rename_folder`, `delete_folder`, which unfiles, `move_folder`, `set_subscription_folder`). File a subscription by dragging it onto a folder (onto the "Subscriptions" heading unfiles it), from its context menu (Move to folder ›), or on the Subscriptions screen; folders are made with Blyg › New Folder… or the pane's context menu, renamed, deleted, and reordered by dragging or Move Up / Move Down. Keys: ←/→ move between the panes, ↑/↓ within one (the sources pane picks as it moves; in the post pane they scroll), j/k next/previous post from anywhere, ⏎ goes right, Space pages through the post and then opens the next unread one, esc returns to the list, [ / ] step through versions (←/→ still do in the stream's pane). ⌥⌘S (Blyg › Sources Pane, or the header's button) hides the pane; its edge drags to resize (`state.json`: `reader_sources_hidden`, `reader_sources_width`). **Picking and marking** (`reading/marks.rs`, model `pick_vm.rs`): ⌘-click adds or drops a post, ⇧-click adds the run from the anchor, ⌘A picks everything the list shows, esc lets go; **r** marks the picks (else the open post) read and **u** unread, as does the row menu (right-click: Mark Read / Mark N Unread). Marks are local and instant (`Backend::set_read`); how they reach the server is docs/SERVER.md § Extension 5. **Subscriptions** (studio 0.30): a subscription's menu in the pane has **Rename…** (a name of your own, kept when the blyg renames itself), **Use the Blyg's Own Name** once renamed (`title: null`; `Subscription::title_follows_source`), and **Check Now** (a blyg's index reconciled at once, `POST /subscriptions/{id}/resync`; a feed is polled with the rest); the pane's menu and **⇧⌘R** (Blyg › Check All Feeds Now) poll every feed (`POST /subscriptions/poll`). A pull follows each, and another a few seconds later.

**OPML import and export** (`blyg_core::opml`, `reading/opml.rs`; blygger/blygger-studio#63). Blyg › Import Subscriptions from OPML… (and Import OPML… on the Subscriptions screen; no key) opens a file picker, then a sheet in the Publish/Delete chrome listing the file's feeds: one OPML parser (`opml::outlines`, also behind `profile::parse_opml`) reads OPML 1.0/2.0 leniently (nested outlines flattened, the folder kept for display only, `xmlUrl` required, `title` else `text`, HTML entities and double escaping undone, BOM / UTF-16 / Windows-1252-labelled-UTF-8 decoded), at most 5 MB and 2,000 feeds, never fetching. Duplicates collapse by normalised feed URL; a feed already followed (same normalised feed URL, or under a blyg subscription's origin) shows "already following" and starts unticked. Keys: 1–9 / Space tick, ↑/↓, ⌘A all or none, ⏎ Import N, esc cancel. The run (`opml::run_import`, off the main thread) sends `POST /api/subscriptions {url, confirm:true}` per feed with no title (the source names itself) and no separate resolve, two at a time with starts ≥ 2 s apart (≤ 30 a minute, far under the owner write budget, because each subscribe backfills the archive server-side); a 429 holds every worker for its `Retry-After` and retries that feed (5 times at most). 201 is added, 409 already following, 422 not a feed (the server's reason shown), Offline unreachable, anything else refused with its reason; nothing fails the whole run. Esc stops after the requests in flight. Each added subscription is filed (by the id in the 201) in the local Reader folder **Imported feeds**, made on first use and reused by name; 409s are never moved, and the OPML's folders never become folders. `createSubscription` has no `in_blogroll` member and new rows default to `in_blogroll = 0`, so imports stay out of the public blogroll without a PATCH. The summary gives the counts and each failure with Retry failed (r). Blyg › Export Subscriptions as OPML… saves OPML 2.0 of every subscription (save dialog, `burrow-subscriptions.opml`), in the studio's `blogroll.opml` shape: `text`/`title` the name, `type="rss"`, `xmlUrl` the feed, `htmlUrl` the origin. Both need a connected blyg. CLI: `blygger +import-opml <file> [--dry-run]` (skips feeds already followed, files into the same folder; opens the local database without the sync worker) and `blygger +export-opml <file>`.

**Quote boxes and lineage lines open the original** (`reading/original.rs`, issue #3). In the reader's WebView each resolved quote box gets a footer, "quoted from &lt;name&gt; · v2 · open original" (added by the app's reader layer after sanitizing, `studio::reader::quote_footers`; blyg-render's output is unchanged): the name opens the origin's profile, a click anywhere else in the box opens the original post. The stream's quote boxes and the "↳ stub of …" / "⑂ forked from …" lines (stream and reader header) work the same way: the name goes to the profile, the rest to the post. A post held in the reading store opens at once, at the quoted version when that version is current or pinned (unpinned versions are never shown); one that isn't held is fetched from its author's public item document (`Backend::public_item`, `public_pinned`: the token-less `PublicClient`, only on that click) and shown with Subscribe / Reply · new stub / Open on web, never marked read.

**Responses: who quoted, stubbed or forked a post** (`reading/responses.rs`, issue #7). A list, never a count: who · "quoted this" / "stubbed this" / "forked this" · when, each opening that post. Two sources: for your own posts, the verified, unhidden mentions (`GET /api/mentions`), listed under the post in ⌘Y and in the reading pane when your own post is open there; for anyone's post, "seen in your network": reading rows, and your own published posts, whose `transclusions`, `stub_of` or `forked_from` point at it (`Backend::responses`, an index lookup on the derived `reading_refs` table, schema v6, rewritten on every upsert; a quote without an origin is from the quoting post's own blyg). One response per post: a stub thread both stubs and quotes its target, which is one act, so the strongest relation wins (fork > stub > quote), and a quote with a `selector` marks it partial ("stubbed a passage of this"; `reading_refs.partial`, schema v9). This is the one-hop lineage blygger-studio's lineage view computes server-side (studio PR #35, `GET /api/lineage`), with the same rules, from what this Mac holds. The list sits at the bottom of the reading pane, and stays a list without a count; in the stream the lineage glyph (below) marks a post that has any.

**Lineage** (`reading/lineage.rs`, model `lineage_vm.rs`; mock `docs/prototype/lineage.html`). A **glyph** beside each stream post's name replaces the old "↩": lines in from the left are the kinds of post it draws on, lines out to the right the kinds that draw on it, in fixed slots (fork, reply, quote; amber, accent, green), dotted when every one of that kind is of a passage, then **"up · down"**: how many it draws on and how many known here draw on it (rule 1's lineage exception, 2026-10-09). The counts are blygger-studio's `lineage-glyph` extension's (studio PR #53, ported from commit dc632c5 in `blyg-core/src/lineage.rs`): one reference per (post, target), fork > stub > quote, a `{url}` stub counts as an ancestor, a bare quote means the quoting post's own blyg; descendants are held posts that reference it, one per post, plus, for your own posts, verified mentions (hidden ones too) from posts not already counted. Plain totals, uncapped, as the studio prints them; the tooltip gives the counts by kind in words. **Where the numbers come from:** on a node that serves the extension (`GET /api/ext/lineage-glyph/summaries` and `/lineage`, `owner:read`), from it: summaries for the reading rows (50 keys a request, by reading entry key `imported:["sub","id"]`) and the graph for ⌘J, cached in the store's `lineage_cache` (fresh for 30 s, the studio's `FRESH_MS`; asked again when the reading list changes or opens). Whether it's served is found out by asking: a 404 means "not enabled there", silently, remembered for six hours (meta `lineage_glyph`), and its cached answers are dropped. Otherwise, and offline before any answer, Burrow counts from what this Mac holds with the same rules (`lineage::Local`). **⌘J** (or a click on the glyph) opens the lineage sheet: the post in a hexagon, what it draws on above, what draws on it below ("what your blyg knows" when the node served the graph, else "what this Mac holds": reading rows, your published posts, verified mentions of your posts), at most five a row around the selection, with the count each way beside the hexagon and on the side list's headings. A `{url}` stub is a neighbour that's a page, not a post: `o` opens it in the browser and it can't be the centre. Arrows move; ⏎ on a neighbour makes it the centre and ⌫ walks back; `o` opens the selected post in the reader; esc closes. **Space** (or ⏎) on the centre opens the **ring**: the reader's actions in blygger-studio's compass positions (right Fork, lower right Reply, lower left Quote, left Link post, upper left Versions, upper right Open). A letter (f r q l v o) previews the action: a dashed node where its result would go, and the same four facts for every action (a response? the author told? their words in yours? shown under their post?). Each of Fork, Reply and Quote shows how many of that kind are already known ("R · 2"), and the panel says so in words. ⏎ or the same letter again does it; esc backs out a layer at a time. The ring uses existing actions only. Opening a post from the sheet (`o`, Versions) goes through the reader's own open, so a held post is marked read as a click in the list marks it (`Backend::mark_read`; subject to change in review). Until 2026-10-09 Burrow's glyph showed kinds only while the web Studio's showed counts; both now show the same numbers.

**Posts are dated by their author, not by the import.** The list sorts newest first by the post's own `updated` (else `created`), so an author's edit moves the post up; a row says "edited 3d ago" when `updated` is more than ten minutes after `created`, else shows when it was published. `observed_at` (when your blyg imported it) is only the fallback for a post with no usable date. Dates parse as RFC 3339 or RFC 2822 (`ReadingItem::post_time`); the store keeps the normalized sort key in `reading.sort_at` (indexed).

**Read state syncs through your blyg when the server supports it.** Read state is a number per reading row: the highest version you've read. Marking a post read is always instant and local, and it marks every duplicate of the same post. When the blyg advertises read-state sync (extension 5, `docs/SERVER.md`), the same mark also queues a `read` op per row in the outbox, which is sent like any other change (offline-safe, retried, coalesced to the highest version per row). A pull merges `max(local, server)`, so read state never goes backwards. The first time a database sees the capability, it uploads everything it has read in batches, once, and records that in `meta`. So a post read on one Mac reads as read on your others, and a fresh install isn't all unread. Without the extension, read state stays on this Mac, and nothing is sent. Nothing new is shown in the UI. The writes need the bearer scope `reading:state` (studio 0.39+; the name is provisional, kept in `oauth::READ_STATE_SCOPE`), which the browser sign-in asks for. A sign-in or token without it (one made before 0.39) gets a 403: the read ops stay queued, the rest of the outbox syncs, and Burrow says once that read state is waiting and to sign in again; the next sign-in sends what waited.

**Search, Notational Velocity style.** A search field sits above the reading list (the Posts omnibar isn't on this screen). ⌘F or `/` (with the list focused) puts the caret in it; typing filters the list live: a case-insensitive substring over the title, the author and blyg (subscription, origin) names, and the post's text (`content_md`, or the published HTML's text when an item has no Markdown), over posts **already held locally**. Nothing is fetched to search. Title matches are highlighted as in the Posts list. ↑/↓ move through the matches from the field, ⏎ goes to the list (opening the first match when nothing is open), and esc clears the search (esc on an empty field returns to the list; esc in the list with a search clears it before it leaves the screen). An empty result shows "No posts match “…”". The open post stays open while it still matches; otherwise the selection and the reader clear, so typing never opens (or marks read) anything.

**The post is shown as its blyg published it.** The body is the published `content_html` (a pin's own `content_html` when the pill is on a pin), with its transclusion snapshots already baked in, followed by the attached images from the item document's `media[]`. It is sanitized (an `ammonia` allowlist: no scripts, handlers, `javascript:` URLs, forms, objects, or iframes other than youtube-nocookie embeds; images get `referrerpolicy="no-referrer"`) and shown in a WKWebView under a strict CSP, with `<base href>` at the author's origin (protocol media paths such as `media/x.png` are origin-relative) and the app's reader theme (Literata, Tufte palette, light/dark). Only an item without HTML falls back to rendering its `content_md` with `blyg-render`, resolving quotes from items held for the same origin. The header, pill, thumbs, notes, diff and actions stay native. The same view shows the current version in ⌘Y. Only one WebView is on screen at a time: the studio preview hides wherever the reader shows.

## AI / TK

The blyg's AI feature is TK: `[TK]instruction[/TK]` → `[TK]instruction[=]output[/TK]`. See `docs/BLYGGER-SPEC-DIGEST.md` §AI and the mock at `docs/prototype/ai-and-reading.html`. Text generated in the app must be recorded as provenance (the provenance extension in `docs/SERVER.md`) so that it's disclosed as `blyg-tk-gen`. The app never offers a direct claude.ai or ChatGPT subscription login (Anthropic prohibits it; OpenAI has no sanctioned route).

## AI providers & sign-in

The app will be used by **other people** too, so every user signs in to their own accounts. Providers:

| Provider | How | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ChatGPT account | Sign in with ChatGPT (browser PKCE + device-code fallback) via OpenAI's Codex OAuth client → ChatGPT Codex Responses endpoint, the way pi does it | Requested feature. Unofficial: it may break or be blocked by OpenAI, and the UI says so once. |
| OpenAI API key | Paste the key (Keychain) | Official. |
| Anthropic API key | Paste the key (Keychain) | Official. |
| Cloudflare Workers AI | Account ID + API token (Keychain); OpenAI-compatible chat completions | Default model **Gemma 4** `@cf/google/gemma-4-26b-a4b-it`. |
| Local Claude Code / Codex | Spawn the user's installed `claude -p` / `codex exec` | Uses whatever account those tools are signed into. |
| Blyg server | Existing `/api/items/:id/generate` | Off by default today. A Worker can generate with Gemma 4 through its Workers AI binding (see `docs/SERVER.md`). |

**Not built:** a direct claude.ai (Pro/Max) subscription login. Anthropic's terms prohibit third-party apps from offering claude.ai login or using subscription limits. The local Claude Code bridge is the supported way to use a Claude subscription.

Disclosure: **always on**. Edited reading items move **to the top**. Helpers in v1: fill a gap (TK), shorten to fit 1000, continue this thought, outline a thread, proofread (not disclosed), reply to a reading item.

## Onboarding & tutorial

The first launch is an onboarding flow: connect a blyg (URL plus token, or owner password), then optionally connect AI accounts. After that comes an **interactive tutorial** that walks through the features (the ▶ demos in the mocks are the script), with a "Show this tutorial every time I open Burrow" checkbox. It can be re-enabled or replayed from Settings › Help. **After an update**, the first launch of a newer version opens the tutorial on a "What's new in Burrow x.y" card (`onboarding/whats_new.rs`, compared with `seen_version` in state.json): ⏎ starts at the first new step, "Take the whole tour" starts at the beginning, esc or "Skip tutorial" closes it. A first run never sees it.

**Every release updates the tour and the docs (the maintainer's rule).** A new feature gets a step in `onboarding/steps.rs` that lands on it (its `since` is the release), steps whose UI changed are edited, and the release's what's-new entry starts at the first of its own steps; `whats_new.rs`'s tests fail otherwise, and fail for an x.y.0 version with no entry. A step that teaches the running version's news says "NEW IN x.y.z" on its card. The tour runs on the FakeBackend and also on **sample extensions** (`extensions/tour.rs`): the user's extension host is parked and a tour host runs the bundled markdown-notes (two sample folders allowed, one not), reading-time and inspect over invented notes in `<data dir>/tour-sample/`, deleted when the tour ends (and cleared when the next one starts); nothing in the tour writes the config file (Allow, Turn on/off, Forget permissions and the notes folders' Add and Remove say what they would do instead). The cross-post step shows a sample run in the pane (■ Stop, then "macro running · show pane" once folded) with nothing running, and ✂ Clip on the sample page clips its sample text. The `opml` step rings the Subscriptions screen's header; its **Import OPML…** chip opens the preview of a sample export (one feed already followed, two new) instead of a file picker, and importing it subscribes in the sample data.

## Protocol philosophy → UI rules (from the creator's talk, blygger.org/talks/2026-09-24-blygger/)

Core principle: *"anything the protocol can't verify, it declines to represent."* The app is a **studio**. It follows these rules:

1. **No counts, anywhere social.** Responses and mentions are shown as *a list, never a count*: who, origin, relation, when. Mentions and responses never get numeric badges; use a dot for "something new". There are no follower lists or follower counts: following is client-local and invisible. (A reader-local unread count for *your own* reading list is fine; it's private state, not a social metric. So are a post's word count and reading time, which describe the text, not its audience: the opt-in `reading-time` extension.)
   **One exception, the lineage glyph (2026-10-09, the user's decision).** The lineage glyph beside a post, the ⌘J lineage view and its action ring show *how many* posts a post draws on and how many known here draw on it, by kind (stub, quote, fork), next to the kinds, because the web Studio's `lineage-glyph` extension shows the same numbers and the data is there. The numbers are blygger-studio's, counted by its rules (from the node when it serves the extension, else from this Mac). The exception covers those three surfaces only: responses lists, mentions, profiles and everything else social stay lists without counts.
2. **Generation happens in the studio, at authoring time, with review.** Publishing never generates. The TK tint shows in the editor only; published bytes are identical, apart from the `generated` metadata and the `blyg-tk-gen` class. Provenance is self-asserted, so the app always records it (the provenance extension).
3. **Transclusion is quoting, and it's snapshotted at publish.** Later edits to the source never rewrite the quote. The picker offers only what's already held (your own posts plus imported items from blyg subscriptions). It never fetches by URL. The picker opens with ⌘K, or by typing `![[` at the start of a line in a thread (after optional indent, outside a fenced code block): the typed `![[` comes out, what you type next filters the picker, ⏎ inserts the whole `![[id]]` line, and esc puts the `![[` back so it can be typed literally. Only typing triggers it, never a paste. In a fragment it shows the "Quotes go in threads" toast and leaves the text alone.
4. **Forking descends from pins only.** Pins are the costly, irrevocable signal: confirm with plain words ("This version will be served forever. You can't undo this.").
5. **No deletes of published work. Withdraw instead**: permanent, visible, and irreversible. Only drafts can be discarded. The UI says "Withdraw", never "Delete", for published items.
6. **No identity layer.** No @handles or accounts. The origin (domain) is the name, and author names are optional decoration.
7. **Stubs are the reply shape.** "Reply to a reading item" creates a stub thread (`stub_of`), usually transcluding the source. The reading actions name the primitive they create: **Reply · new stub** (`stub_of`), **Quote into a thread** (`![[id]]` in a thread of yours), **Fork** (`forked_from`, from a pin) and **Link post · new fragment** (a new fragment holding `[[id]]`, a plain link with no `stub_of` and no mention; blyg posts only), each with a one-sentence tooltip saying what gets made. Reply stays the one "I am responding" action, and (blygger-studio 0.31) it always opens quoting the whole post: `![[id]]` and a blank line, the server's own prefill. The passage is chosen in the stub editor (`reading/stub_bar.rs`): a hint line above the text names what the draft does (the whole post; a passage; N passages, a running commentary; or no quote, a response by link), **quote a passage instead** shows the post's text read-only, and a selection there becomes `>` lines under the directive (`withStubQuote`), or, once a passage exists, another quote after the caret (`addStubQuote`); **quote whole post** takes it out again. The text logic is `blyg_render::stub_quote`, a port of the studio's `stub-quote.ts`: the first own-line `![[id]]` outside code and its attached `>` run, found the way publish finds them. The reading pane's selection pill only quotes into a draft (⇧⌘D); ⇧⌘D into a stub of the same post goes through the same functions, so it never adds a second directive.
8. **Titles are the author's own words.** Items stay titleless on the wire; the app derives a title (`blyg_core::plain_title`) from the first line of text, so a leading heading is the title on every surface (posts list, reading list, stream). Blockquote lines are skipped, including the `>` run attached to a `![[id]]` (a partial transclusion), so a thread is never named by what it quotes; a stub with nothing of its own yet reads "In response to &lt;host&gt;" (blygger-studio 0.8.2).
9. **Tolerate the unknown.** Ignore unknown kinds and fields; never reject. The wire is v0.3 and pre-1.0 unstable.

## Client-recorded provenance (owner-API extension, see `docs/SERVER.md`)

- `PUT /api/items/:id/tk-provenance {content_md?, scopes: [ {index, model, sources?:[{id,version}], at?} | null ]}` → `{ok, disclosed}`. Validation runs first and nothing is written on a 400. `scopes.length` must equal the number of TK scopes in the (new) working copy.
- `GET /api/items/:id/tk-provenance` → `{scopes: [...]}`.
- **The server keys provenance by scope POSITION.** A plain `PUT /api/items/:id` that adds, removes or reorders scopes shifts disclosure onto the wrong span. Rule for blyg-core: **whenever the set of TK scopes changes, push the text with the combined call** (`content_md` + the full `scopes` array), never a plain PUT. Track provenance locally per scope (model, sources, at). A scope the user rewrote entirely by hand → `null`.

## Versions & pins (user requirement + spec §5.2/§8.4, mock: `docs/prototype/versions.html`)

- **Reading list: one entry per post** (latest version). A **version browser** (⌘Y) opens from any post.
- **Other people's posts:** the version UI shows **only the current version and pinned versions**. Unpinned versions don't appear at all, in any form (§8.4, and a deliberate product decision). The pinned list comes from the public item document's `changelog` (`pinned: true`) and each pinned body from `{origin}items/{id}/v{n}.json`. **Compact control:** there's no sidebar. The version pill in the post header is a `‹ vN ▾ ›` control: the arrows step through current + pinned versions, and the pill opens a small dropdown list. Actions are shown inline, labelled with what they create: **Quote into a thread** / **Reply · new stub** / **AI reply · new stub** / **Fork** / **Link post · new fragment** / **Open on web** for the current version; **Quote this version** / **Fork this pin** / **Diff vs now** / **Back to current** for a pinned one. Fork is available only on pinned versions: on the current version it's shown **greyed out**, and its tooltip says why and where to go ("Fork needs a pinned version: pick 📌 vN in ‹ vM ▾ › (or press [), then Fork this pin", or that the post has no pins). Every action chip has a one-sentence tooltip saying what gets made (a stub thread, `![[id]]` in a thread, a quoted pin with a link, a forked thread draft).
- **"Edited since you read it":** store only `read_version` (a number). Show the author's changelog notes for the versions in between. A **text diff only when the version you read was pinned** (both sides public). Never retain the unpinned text of past versions of other people's posts.
- **Withdrawal of others' posts:** drop the content locally (*"Local hoarding past withdrawal is nonconforming"*), except pinned versions, which may be retained with attribution linking the pin.
- **Own posts:** your history is private to you. Every version can be opened and restored (a restore loads it into the editor; publishing makes vN+1, and versions never go backwards). Pinning uses a type-to-confirm sheet ("You can't undo this").
- Public fetches to other origins are **unauthenticated**: never send the owner token anywhere but the user's own blyg.

## Profiles (mock: `docs/prototype/profiles.html`, agreed as-is)

Who someone is, whom they read, and one click to follow them or anyone they quote, stub or fork.
- **Sources, all public:** a blyg's `blyg.json` (author name, bio, avatar resolved against the origin, links), `blogroll.opml` only when the manifest lists it (OPML outlines: title, xmlUrl, htmlUrl), `items/index.json` (recent items; titles from `feed.xml` or from posts already held), or, for a plain RSS/Atom feed, a simpler card (title, link, recent items). A feed with `<blyg:manifest>` is treated as a blyg.
- **Privacy:** fetched with the token-less `PublicClient` (no token, no cookies) and **only when the user opens a profile**, never in the background or on a poll. Cached in SQLite (`profiles`, with `fetched_at`); opening a profile younger than an hour uses the cache without a request, ↻ refreshes, and a failed fetch falls back to the cached copy (marked stale). The origin sees the user's IP, as a browser visit would.
- **Discovery** reuses the subscribe preview's resolution: your own blyg and your subscriptions first, then `POST /api/subscriptions` (preview). Only when that's unavailable does core probe `{url}blyg.json`, then the URL as a feed. No crawling.
- **Connections** (origins a blyg quotes, stubs and forks) come from that blyg's posts already held locally (`stub_of`, `forked_from`, `transclusions`, `data-blyg-origin` in their HTML) plus quote sources in their feed. Each row says "stubbed 2 posts" / "forked 1 pin" / "quoted 3 times": the author's own data, not a social metric. Your own profile's connections come from your published posts.
- **No counts:** no follower, subscriber or reader counts anywhere. Lists only.
- **Follow** = subscribe preview + subscribe in one step, with a toast; following is private and client-local. Unfollow lives in Subscriptions. **Add to my blogroll** is separate and deliberate (subscribes first if needed, then sets `in_blogroll`), because the blogroll is public.
- **Entry points:** ⌘I (the reading item's origin; your own blyg anywhere else), the author's address in the reading header, the lineage line under it (`↳ stub of …`, `⑂ forked from … vN 📌`), the origin in each mention, blogroll and connection entries inside a profile (profile → profile, with a back arrow), Blyg › My Profile, and ⇧⌘O "Open profile…" (paste any URL).
- **Own profile:** what visitors see (your public manifest), "Edit site settings…", and every subscription with its blogroll toggle.
- **Sheet:** slides in from the right over the reading pane; esc closes, ↑/↓ and ⏎ move and open, F follows the selected entry, ⇥ switches tabs, ← goes back. It suppresses the native web views like other sheets.
- Core: `Backend::profile(url, refresh)` and `Backend::cached_profile(url)` (`blyg_core::profile`); `ReadingItem` carries `stub_of`, `forked_from` and `transclusions` (read leniently from the reading JSON; the owner-API reading extension should pass them through from the item document).

- **Lineage** ("↳ stub of", "⑂ forked from", quote origins) comes from the reading item when the server sends it, and otherwise from the post's public item document (`items/{id}.json`), which the app already fetches, unauthenticated, when a post is opened. The reference Worker's importer doesn't keep `stub_of`/`forked_from`. Connections use only documents already fetched; nothing is fetched just for them.

## Full editor ("studio mode"; mock: `docs/prototype/studio.html`)

A local full editor like the web studio: **source | live preview**, the preview showing the document exactly as published.
- **Modes:** ⌘1 write (list + editor), ⌘2 list + editor + preview, ⌘3 full editor (editor + preview, list hidden). ⌘E toggles the preview in place. There is one renderer for all of them (retire the separate native pulldown→GPUI preview).
- **Renderer:** a Rust port of the reference Worker's studio preview pipeline. Markdown with markdown-it semantics (`html: false`, linkify), plus the common embeds extension (a bare YouTube link on its own line → the click-to-load facade `figure.blyg-yt`; off-origin `<img>` gets `referrerpolicy="no-referrer"`; a failed remote image → a visible link fallback). TK scopes → output wrapped in `blyg-tk-gen` with the studio tint; ungenerated → `⚠ ungenerated — <instruction>`. Transclusions `![[id]]` (threads) resolve from the **local store only** (own published items + imported reading items), rendered as `blockquote.blyg-transclusion` with provenance; unresolved → the `.unresolved` marker. **Parity tests** use fixtures generated by running the Worker's own TS renderer via node.
- **View:** a WKWebView (e.g. `wry`) embedded in the GPUI window. Styled with the blyg's own public `/style.css` (fetched, cached, and used offline), plus the studio additions (tint, unresolved). No JS from content; our own small script handles the YouTube click-to-play (youtube-nocookie) and the image fallback. Links open in the default browser; no in-view navigation.
- **Speed:** re-render ~100 ms after typing pauses, patching the DOM in place (no flicker, scroll kept). Source ↔ preview jump via block line maps (`data-line`).
- **Status bar** counts quotes, AI spans, videos and images, and warns about unresolved quotes before publish.

## Scratch notes (local-only)

Quick capture is for collecting thoughts, not for deciding. So:
- **Quick capture saves a local scratch note by default.** esc, ⌘S or clicking away saves it. ⌘D saves it as a **draft** on the blyg instead (synced, unpublished). ⌘⏎ **publishes** it immediately.
- **Scratch notes are local-only.** They're stored in the local SQLite database, never enqueued to the outbox, never pushed or pulled, and never sent anywhere unless the user invokes AI on them. They show in the main list with a `scratch` pill, are searchable, and are fully editable.
- **Promotion:** ⌘D (make draft) creates the server draft from the scratch note (the same item keeps its local id, so there's no duplicate). ⌘⏎ publishes, creating it first if needed. The kind is chosen at promotion (`blyg_core::promotion_kind`): fragment when ≤ 1000 (server count), otherwise a thread; a note the user already made a thread (⌘T) stays one. `Backend::promote` returns the chosen kind, and the UI says so ("published as a thread"). A scratch note's length never blocks ⌘⏎. Offline, `Promote::Publish` still promotes (the draft's `create` queues in the outbox) and the publish fails with `Offline`. There's no demotion back to scratch once a note is on the server; drafts are discarded or withdrawn instead.
- **Images in scratch notes stay local.** A paste or drop into a scratch note copies the image to
  `<data dir>/scratch-media/<sha256>.<ext>` and inserts `![](blyg-local:<sha256>.<ext>)`; both previews
  show it from disk. Promotion uploads each one (without `item_id`) and rewrites the references to
  `<blyg origin>/media/<id>.<ext>` before the item is created. A failed upload refuses the promotion
  (the note stays scratch). Offline, the uploads go with the queued `create`.
- ⌘N (New Post) starts a **scratch note** in an empty editor (see § Interaction spec, "New post"), unless the config sets `new-note = draft`. The main window's omnibar create stays a **draft** (unchanged), unless the config sets `new-note = scratch`.
- Core: `Status::Scratch` (stored as `items.status = 'scratch'`), `Backend::create_scratch(kind, content_md)`, `Backend::promote(id, to: Promote::Draft|Promote::Publish{note}) -> Promoted{kind, published}`. `save`, `set_kind`, `search` and `delete_draft` work on scratch items locally; `publish` on one promotes it first. The sync engine ignores local-only items. Tests: scratch never hits the network (mock server asserts zero requests), promotion keeps the id, and offline promotion queues.
- Config keys: `capture-default = scratch|draft` (default scratch) and `new-note = draft|scratch` (unset by default: ⌘N starts a scratch note and the omnibar creates a draft; when set, both follow it; `Config::new_post` / `Config::new_note`).

### Notes drawer

A scratchpad for running notes while reading (issue: "notes while I browse"). Code: `crates/blyg-app/src/notes/`.

- **Where:** a drawer that slides in over the right edge of the window (380 px, an overlay with a shadow; it never adds a layout column), over the Stream, the Reader, the browser pane and the Posts screen. ⇧⌘N or View › Notes toggles it; esc (while it has the keyboard) or a click outside slides it back, and the keyboard returns where it was. Web views it overlaps (the reader, the preview, the browser pane) are cut off at its edge while it's out, as the browser pane does. The browser pane makes room: its right edge meets the drawer's left edge (slide mode moves over, full mode is inset), sliding alongside it, so its chrome stays uncovered. A click on an add action (→ Notes) while the drawer is out isn't a click away.
- **Backed by a scratch note:** one rolling note, "Reading notes" (`# Reading notes` as its first line), made a thread so `![[id]]` quotes are valid in it. It's created with the first real text, autosaved on every edit, local only, listed in Posts with its `scratch` pill, and remembered in `state.json` (`notes_note`; otherwise the newest scratch note titled "Reading notes…" is picked up). The header shows its title, **⌘D → draft** (promotes it; the drawer starts a new page), **Open in editor**, and ⋯ › **New notes page** (a fresh "Reading notes · Sep 27"; the old one stays in Posts). ⌘⏎ in the drawer opens it in the editor with the publish sheet. The editor is the same textarea setup as quick capture, with @-mentions, spellcheck and paste-a-link-over-a-selection.
- **Adding:** "→ Notes" in the stream's action row, the reader's action row and the side pane appends `![[id]]` for a blyg post (or, when the note was made a fragment, `[title](page url)` with the first line as a `>` quote) and `[title](url)` for a feed post, then opens the drawer with the caret on a new line below. The browser pane's → Notes appends `[title](url)`. With text selected in the reading pane's post or the browser page, ⇧⌘N (or → Notes) quotes it as a `>` blockquote ending `> — [title](url)` (read with a small script, `window.getSelection()`, at most 4000 characters).
- Not possible (yet): selecting the stream's native text (GPUI text has no selection), and dropping a link from another app onto the drawer (GPUI only accepts dropped files).
- **Universal quoting** (⇧⌘D, Post › Quote Selection in Draft, the browser pane's **→ Draft**; `notes/quote.rs`): the passage highlighted in the notes drawer (when it has the keyboard), else the browser page, else the reading pane's post, goes into the draft or scratch note open in the editor, at its caret, or into a new draft when none is open (a thread for a blyg passage, else a fragment unless it's too long). The Markdown is one pure function, `reading::vm::quote_block`: a passage from a blyg post we hold (the reading pane's post, or a browser page on a followed blyg's origin whose path names a held post's id), going into a thread, and really in the version we hold, is a partial transclusion, `![[id]]` with the passage attached as `>` lines (no blank line between; a paragraph break is a bare `>` line, studio's `quoteLines`). Anything else (a fragment, which can't transclude; a web page; a passage not in the held version) is a `>` blockquote of the passage ending `> — [title](url)`. From the notes, a passage inside a quote that ends in such a source line keeps that link; the note has no source URL of its own, so anything else goes in without one. Nothing selected: a toast, and nothing is made.

## Buttons (optional toolbar)

Keyboard-first, but not keyboard-only. Config `show-buttons = true|false` (**default true** for new installs; the maintainer sets `false`). It's toggled in Settings (⌘,) and offered in the first-run tutorial ("Buttons or keyboard?").
- A quiet toolbar in the title-bar row, with icons plus short labels: **New** (⌘N: a scratch note, or a draft with `new-note = draft`), **Make draft**, **Publish**, **View: Write / Preview / Full editor**, **Versions**, **Generate (AI)**, **Delete** / **Withdraw** (one slot: Delete on a draft or scratch note, Withdraw on a published post; never Delete for published work), **Quick capture**. The quick-capture panel gets the same row: **Scratch · Draft · Publish**.
- **Generated from the single keymap table** (action, key, context, menu label, icon, button label), so buttons, menus and shortcuts can't drift. Every tooltip shows the shortcut, so the buttons teach the keys.
- Buttons are disabled with a reason in the tooltip when unavailable (e.g. Publish on an over-limit fragment: "Too long for a fragment. ⌘T makes it a thread").
- With `show-buttons = false`, the window is exactly the minimalist layout in the mocks.
- As built (`crates/blyg-app/src/toolbar.rs`): the rows live in `keymap::table()` (`icon`, `button`), the order in `keymap::TOOLBAR` and `keymap::CAPTURE_ROW`; a click dispatches the row's action. The row sits between the traffic lights and the view switcher; the centred title shows only when there's room, and a narrow window gets icons only. Buttons other than Quick capture work on the Posts screen and wait for an open sheet. Disabled reasons reuse `vm::publish_decision` / `vm::make_draft_blocked`. In quick capture the row replaces the key hints (each button shows its key); with `capture-default = draft` there's no Scratch button. Reading (⌘R) and Quote (⌘K) have no button: the view switcher already is Reading, and Quote is thread-only. Delete and Withdraw share a slot (`toolbar::visible`, `vm::discard`); Withdraw is the one button without a key, so its tooltip is just "Withdraw…". Icons: twelve Lucide icons (ISC). Tests: `keymap` (every button bound, key in tooltip), `menu_tests` (menus = table), `toolbar_tests`, `discard_tests`, capture tests.

## Updates (in-app, signed)

Config `auto-update = install | notify | off` (**default install**). Burrow › Check for Updates… always checks, whatever the key says, and answers with a toast ("You're up to date (0.3.0)").

- **When:** 15 s after launch, then about every 24 h while running. `state.json` remembers the last check that found nothing newer (`last_update_check`), so relaunches within a day don't call the API again; a check that found an update isn't recorded, so a relaunch looks again. A failed check retries in an hour. Never in `cfg(test)`, with `BLYGGER_FAKE=1`, or with `BLYGGER_NO_UPDATE=1`.
- **What:** `GET https://api.github.com/repos/<repo>/releases/latest` (unauthenticated, with a User-Agent). Drafts, prereleases and pre-release tags are skipped; the tag is compared as semver against `CARGO_PKG_VERSION`.
- **install:** download and verify in the background, then a sheet: "Burrow X is ready to install" with **Restart Now** and **Later** (asked once per release; Check for Updates… asks again), and the status-bar notice "Burrow X is ready · Restart to update · What's new". Restart installs and relaunches; quitting with an update ready installs it too (no relaunch). **notify:** a sheet "Burrow X is available" with **Download and Install** and **Later**, and the notice "Burrow X is available · Download · What's new"; Download proceeds as install. **off:** no automatic checks.
- **Security model** (all must pass, or nothing is installed):
  1. HTTPS only, from `api.github.com`, `github.com`, and GitHub's release-asset storage hosts (`objects.githubusercontent.com`, `release-assets.githubusercontent.com`). Redirects are followed by hand and every hop is checked.
  2. The release workflow signs `SHA256SUMS` with the project's Ed25519 key (secret `UPDATE_SIGNING_KEY`, `scripts/sign-sums.sh`, OpenSSL 3 `pkeyutl -sign -rawin`) and publishes `SHA256SUMS.sig`: the **raw 64-byte signature** over the exact bytes of `SHA256SUMS` (not base64). CI verifies it with the key embedded in the app before uploading, so a wrong key fails the release.
  3. The app embeds the public key (`update/verify.rs`, `RELEASE_PUBLIC_KEY_B64`, raw 32 bytes base64) and checks the signature with `ed25519-dalek`'s `verify_strict` before downloading the zip.
  4. `Burrow-<ver>-macos-universal.zip` (or, when a release has only that, the pre-rename `Blygger-<ver>-macos-universal.zip`) must match its SHA-256 line in the signed `SHA256SUMS`.
  5. The zip is extracted with `ditto -x -k` into a staging folder on the same volume as the running bundle; the extracted `Burrow.app` (or `Blygger.app`) must have `CFBundleIdentifier = org.blygger.desktop`, a `CFBundleShortVersionString` equal to the release's version and strictly newer than the running one, its executable, and pass `codesign --verify --strict` (the ad-hoc signature). These checks run again right before installing.
  6. Only the bundle the app runs from is replaced (from `current_exe()` → `…/X.app/Contents/MacOS/blygger`, and only if that bundle is `org.blygger.desktop`). The swap: old bundle → `.X.app.old`, new bundle in, old removed; if the new one can't be moved in, the old one is put back. A detached `/bin/sh` waits for the process to exit and runs `open -n <bundle>`.
  7. Not running from a bundle (`cargo run`), a translocated copy, or an unwritable folder → notify-only: "Can't update in place: …; download from the release page". A release without `SHA256SUMS.sig` (0.2.0 and earlier) is notify-only too. Quarantine is neither added nor stripped (the app's own downloads aren't quarantined).
- `scripts/install.sh` also checks `SHA256SUMS.sig` when OpenSSL 3 is installed (and the release has one).
- As built: `crates/blyg-app/src/update/` (`check.rs`, `verify.rs`, `net.rs` with the `Http` trait, `install.rs` with the `Tools` trait, `mod.rs` GPUI glue, `view.rs` the status-bar notice). Tests are offline: a fake HTTP client serving a release signed with a throwaway key, fake bundles in temp dirs, swap and rollback. Debug builds only: `BLYGGER_UPDATE_URL` (a local test server; plain HTTP to localhost allowed), `BLYGGER_UPDATE_PUBKEY` (a test key) and `BLYGGER_UPDATE_SMOKE=restart|quit` (act on a ready update without input) for manual smoke tests.

## About window

**Burrow › About Burrow** (the standard app-menu place) and **Help › About Burrow** open one small window (`ShowAbout`; a second request brings it forward):

- **Build:** version, commit short SHA (`-dirty` if the tree was dirty), build date (UTC), profile, architecture of the running slice (and "universal binary" when the executable is fat), macOS version.
- **Updates:** `auto-update`, the last check (`state.json` `last_update_check`), the updater's state (ready to install, available, checking, or why checks are off), and a **Check for Updates…** button (the menu's check).
- **Connection:** the blyg's host only (never the token), and what the backend has recorded about the server: reading extensions (`read_extensions_available`), read-state sync (meta `read_sync`, `Backend::read_state_sync`), provenance (`provenance_available`).
- **Files:** the data directory and config file, each with **Reveal in Finder**.
- **Links:** GitHub, this version's release page (`/releases/tag/v<version>`), License. **Copy build info** puts a plain-text block with all of the above except the paths (they contain the user name) on the clipboard, for bug reports.
- As built: `crates/blyg-app/build.rs` embeds `git rev-parse --short HEAD` and `git status --porcelain` (as `unknown` when git is missing or the source isn't a checkout of this repo) and the build time (`SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` when set; `scripts/bundle.sh` sets one for all slices). It re-runs only when HEAD, the index, the refs or a file under `crates/` changes. The release workflow fails on a dirty tree. `crates/blyg-app/src/about/` (`info.rs` is the pure data and copy text). Snapshot: `BLYGGER_DEMO=about`.

## In-app browser

Links in posts open in a browser pane instead of the default browser (`open-links = app | browser`, **default app**). Code: `crates/blyg-app/src/browser/`.

- **Where:** a click opens the pane from the right, over the reading view (two thirds of the window); ⌘-click opens it over the whole area below the title bar; ⌥-click opens the default browser (with `open-links = browser`, a click goes to the default browser and ⌥-click to the pane). esc closes it; ⇧⌘B (View › Show/Hide Browser Pane) brings back the last page, or with none yet opens the pane blank with the address field focused (as View › Open Browser… does). Clicking the same link again doesn't reload. No tabs: `target=_blank` and `window.open` navigate the pane. The reader's and the preview's web views are cut off at the pane's edge (or hidden) while it's open. Other screens open links through `MainView::open_link` (click modifiers decide) or `MainView::open_url_in_app(url, OpenMode)`.
- **Chrome (GPUI):** back, forward, reload/stop (⌘[ ⌘] ⌘R), the address field showing the page title (click or ⌘L to edit; ⏎ loads; only http(s), a bare host gets `https://`), a load progress bar, 🛡 (content blocking on/off for this host), ↗ (open in the default browser), → Notes (appends `[title](url)`, or the page's selection quoted with that link, to the notes drawer; § Notes drawer), ×.
- **Engine:** the same WKWebView (wry) as the reader, a separate instance: created on first use, dropped 3 minutes after the pane closes (its WebContent process exits); reopening then loads the last URL again.
- **Security:** no IPC handler or host script (`window.ipc` is undefined in the page), so pages have no bridge to the app and never see the owner token or keys. Its own website data store: persistent under a fixed identifier on macOS 14+ (sign-ins survive a relaunch, apart from the reader and preview, which use the default store), in memory before macOS 14. Navigation: http(s), `about:blank` and `about:srcdoc` only; `mailto:` goes to the system; `file:`, `data:`, `javascript:`, `blob:` and custom schemes are refused. Downloads are cancelled and handed to the default browser. The bundle allows http:// in web content only (`NSAllowsArbitraryLoadsInWebContent`).
- **Content blocking** (`content-blocking = true | false`, **default true**): WebKit content rule lists (`WKContentRuleList`) built from uBlock Origin's default lists: uBlock filters (ads, badware, privacy, quick fixes, unbreak), EasyList, EasyPrivacy and Peter Lowe's list, fetched from their canonical URLs about weekly (checked on first use and every 6 h while running; never with `BLYGGER_FAKE` or `BLYGGER_NO_BLOCKLIST_DOWNLOAD`) into `<data dir>/browser/lists/`. Until the first download a small bundled list of ad and tracker hosts is used. Conversion: Brave's `adblock` crate (content-blocking feature) in a child process (`blygger +convert-blocklists`, so its memory goes back to the system), `##` rules become `css-display-none`, `#@#` exceptions are folded into the generic rule they undo, rules WebKit can't parse are dropped. WebKit's per-list limit is 150 000 rules, so rules are split into lists of 60 000, each ending with every exception (`ignore-previous-rules` only reaches its own list). Compiled lists are cached by WebKit in `<data dir>/browser/compiled/`, keyed by the lists' content hash (`manifest.json`); a launch looks them up in ~0.1 s. The first page waits at most 0.4 s for the lists. The shield is per host (`state.json`, `browser_unblocked_hosts`), applied before each main-frame navigation. Not possible with content blockers: scriptlets (`##+js`), `$redirect`, `$removeparam` (so uBO's URL-tracking-parameter list is left out), `$csp`, procedural cosmetics (`:has-text`, `:upward`, …) and entity (`site.*`) cosmetics.
- **Checks:** `scripts/browser-block-check.sh` serves a local page with "ads" (a third-party image and script, a `.ad-slot` box) and runs `BLYGGER_DEMO=br-block`, which probes the page with the shield on, off, and on again (`browser-probe …` lines). `br-slide`, `br-full`, `br-reader` and `br-teardown` are the other scenarios.

## Extensions

Extensions add commands and libraries to Burrow without touching its core. Nothing runs unless the config names it.

- **Model:** an extension is a separate process that speaks newline-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdin/stdout ("BXP", the Burrow Extension Protocol, `protocolVersion: 1`). The wire shape borrows from MCP (an `initialize` handshake with `protocolVersion` and capabilities, `notifications/*`, `shutdown`), but the methods are Burrow's own. Any executable that speaks it can be an extension (Python, Node, Rust, a shell script). In-process plugins (no stable ABI, a crash takes the UI down) were rejected. WASM is deferred: the protocol doesn't depend on the transport, so a WASM runner can be added later as a second runner, and it is where enforcement would come from.
- **Isolation:** every call runs on a background thread with a per-method timeout (initialize 5 s, library search 2 s, read 5 s, command 60 s, shutdown 2 s), so the UI never waits on an extension. A crash restarts it with backoff (1 s, 5 s, 30 s), and after three failures in 10 minutes it stays stopped until Reload Config. The child gets a scrubbed environment (no `BLYGGER_*`) and its own `storageDir` under the data dir. Its stderr goes to a capped log there. The extension never receives the owner token, AI credentials, the Keychain service, the database or the data dir. Burrow makes every API call for it. The protocol has no method to publish, withdraw, pin, restore, delete, fork, subscribe or change blyg settings.
- **Capabilities** (the manifest declares them, the config grants them):
  `items.read` (own items' metadata and Markdown), `items.write` (create drafts and scratch notes, save a working copy; it can never publish), `reading.read` (subscription posts already held locally), `blyg.identity` (the blyg's origin, never the token), `ui` (toasts, open an item), `hooks:itemPublished`, `hooks:itemSaved`, `hooks:itemCreated` (receive those notifications), `browser.capture` and `browser.automate:<origin>` (see Browser below), `net` and `fs:<path>`. All but `net` and `fs:` are enforced by the host. A call without the grant fails with `-32001 permission denied: <capability>`. **`fs:` and `net` are declarations, not enforcement:** a native subprocess runs with the user's rights, and the consent sheet says so plainly.
- **Grants live in the config file**, as repeatable keys, which also makes them reviewable and portable:
  ```
  extension = markdown-notes
  extension-allow = markdown-notes ui
  extension-allow = markdown-notes fs:~/Notes
  extension-setting = markdown-notes vault=~/Notes
  ```
  `extension = <name>` enables one, `extension-allow = <name> <capability>` grants one capability, `extension-setting = <name> key=value` is one setting (the extension sees only its own settings). Names and setting keys are lowercase kebab-case, and an unknown capability is a config error.
- **Consent:** the first start of an enabled extension, or a manifest that asks for capabilities not granted yet, shows a sheet ("markdown-notes wants to: read and write files in ~/Notes · show messages"). Each capability can be unticked. Allow writes the `extension-allow` lines (comment-preserving write-back) and starts it. Not now leaves it stopped, with a status-bar notice that reopens the sheet. An extension may ask again with `burrow/requestCapability`, once per capability per session.
- **Install and discovery:** an extension is a folder with an `extension.toml` manifest (name, version, protocol, command, capabilities, commands, libraries, settings) in `~/.config/blygger/extensions/<name>/` (`BLYGGER_EXTENSIONS_DIR` overrides it). Install means copying a folder. There's no registry, download or auto-update. Third-party extensions are allowed in v1. A folder can't shadow a bundled extension's name. `blygger +list-extensions` shows what's installed, enabled, granted and running.
- **Contributions:** commands go in an ⇧⌘P Extensions palette, filtered by where they apply (always, editor, reading, notes). A **library** contribution (`extension/library.list`, `library.search`, `library.read`, `library.write`, the last refusing a stale `baseHash` with `-32002`) gives the host a browsable, searchable, writable collection of Markdown documents. The quote picker can show a library as a read-only chip. Hooks deliver publish, save and create events to extensions granted them. Automatic export happens only for published posts, through `hooks:itemPublished`. Drafts are never sent on their own, only through an explicit command.
- **Browser:** the browser pane is an extension surface behind two enforced capabilities. `browser.capture` gives `burrow/browser.page` while one of the extension's commands runs: the page's address, canonical URL, title, selection, readable text as Markdown and author (`-32004` with no page), never cookies, storage, headers or script. `browser.automate:<origin>` names one website exactly (http(s), host, optional port, no path or wildcards; normalised: lower-case host, `xn--` for international names, default port dropped) and lets the extension's `[[macros]]` run there and `burrow/browser.open` load URLs on it; the consent sheet says "fill in and, when you confirm, click Post on social.example.com, signed in as you". A macro is a declarative recipe in the manifest, run by Burrow, never stepped by the extension: a `[[sites]]` entry (origin, sign-in `home`, optional `signed-out` selector, `content-blocking`, `min-interval`) and steps `open`, `waitFor`, `assert`, `focus`, `click`, `insert`, `submit`, `done`, over `querySelectorAll` selectors with an optional exact text. Its text comes from a template (`{{title}}`, `{{excerpt}}`, `{{permalink}}`) and, optionally, `extension/macro.prepare`. The rules are checked when the manifest loads (`crates/blyg-ext/src/recipe.rs`): every `open` on a declared site, the first step an `open`, exactly one `insert` with a `submit` after it and none before, no `click` after `insert`, `done` last, timeouts at most 30 s. Every run shows the text first (editable), fills the composer in the pane the user watches, shows what the composer holds, and submits only when the user clicks Post; nothing is scheduled, repeated or run in the background. A run uses the ordinary side pane (from the right, two thirds of the window; an open pane is reused as it is, full width after a ⌘-click), and the Preview and Post sheets sit beside it over the app's content so the page stays in view (over the window, the web view hidden, when the pane is full width or less than 360 pt is left beside it). The user can fold the pane while a run goes on (esc, ×, ⇧⌘B): the run keeps going, the web view stays alive (parked off the window's edge, never torn down while a macro runs), and the status bar shows "macro running · show pane" (a click or ⇧⌘B unfolds it). Before any step that types in the page (`focus`, `insert`) and for the Post sheet, the pane unfolds itself: a macro only fills in the pane the user watches. When the run ends the pane goes back to how it was before (folded again if it was folded), except when the user folded or unfolded it during the run, or the page still matters: "I'll click Post myself", a failure (signed out, a step missed), or a stop after Post was clicked. Code: `browser_run_open`, `macro_unfold`, `macro_restore_pane`, `macro_sheet_right`. The pane and macros share the pane's own website data store, where the user signs in by hand; Burrow never reads cookies and never fills a sign-in form.
- **Reading slots** (`blyg_ext::reading`, `extensions/reading_slots.rs`): blygger-studio's extension slots `entryByline` and `entryActions`, over BXP. Behind `reading.read`, an extension can put a short marker at the end of each reading entry's byline (`entry-byline`, `extension/entry.byline`, asked off the main thread when an entry is first drawn and cached by entry and version, so nothing waits and no answer shows nothing) and rows in the entry's ⋯ sheet (`[[entry-actions]]`, `extension/entry.action`): a "⋯" chip in the stream's and the reader's actions lists them, and the answer is drawn natively (text, label/value fields, a monospaced code block with Copy). **Bundled, both off by default:** `reading-time` ("· 4 min" on the byline, the word count on hover) and `inspect` (the record Burrow holds for the entry: ids, versions, references, hashes, and its JSON with bodies elided), ports of the studio 0.39.0 extensions with the same rules, run as `blygger +ext reading-time` / `+ext inspect`. docs/EXTENSIONS.md § Reading slots.
- **Bundled: markdown-notes.** A standalone notes reader and writer over folders of Markdown files (Obsidian vaults, say), deliberately kept apart from blygs, so it works as its own app and with no blyg connected. **Several vaults:** `extension-setting = markdown-notes vault=~/Notes` is the first, and each `vault-<label>=<folder>` (e.g. `vault-work=~/Work/Vault`) adds one; a key per vault survives the config's "later line for the same key wins", and labels follow the config's kebab-case key grammar, so existing `vault=` configs read as before. Each vault is its own library (`notes`, `notes.<label>`), titled by its folder's name (or the label when it's more than that name), and the manifest asks for `fs:<folder>` for each, so consent names every folder. There is no default folder: with no vault it asks only for `ui` and has no library. A vault without its grant refuses with permission denied while the others work. It browses each folder tree, searches titles and bodies (an in-memory index, refreshed by polling), reads a note, creates notes and saves edits. A save is refused if the file changed on disk since it was read, so nothing is overwritten, and it never deletes. Burrow shows notes in its own notes panel. **Copy into post** inserts the selection or the whole note into the current draft at the cursor, either as a quote or verbatim (the user picks). This is a host action, not `items.write`. The **Save selection to notes** command writes a new plain note in the first vault it can use (a command carries no library, so not the drawer's chosen one). It adds no ids or frontmatter to notes (existing frontmatter is kept untouched), and nothing is exported when you publish. It needs only `fs:<folder>` per vault and `ui`, and it runs as `blygger +ext markdown-notes`, through the same host path as a third-party extension. Opt-in through the config and consent like any other.
- **In the window** (`crates/blyg-app/src/extensions/`): the host starts about a second after the window opens, answers extensions from the window's backend (a switch, so connecting or disconnecting a blyg needs no rewiring, and nothing needs a blyg), follows Reload Config, and stops its children on quit. Its toasts name the extension; a failure or a pending permission is a status-bar notice (a click opens Manage extensions or the consent sheet). The **consent sheet** (the Publish/Delete sheets' chrome) lists each capability in `blyg_ext::describe`'s words with a tick (1–9 toggle), then `CONSENT_CAVEAT`; ⏎ Allow writes the ticked `extension-allow` lines (unticked ones aren't asked again this session), esc Not now leaves the notice, ⌘⌫ Turn off backs out (as Manage's Turn off). ⇧⌘P **Extensions…** (Post menu) lists the running extensions' commands for the screen, "Browse <library>", and **Manage extensions…** (what's installed, its state, what's allowed and not, Turn on, Allow…, manifest problems; **Turn off**, in any state, removes its `extension` line, so the reload stops it and its notice goes, while its `extension-allow` and `extension-setting` lines stay for the next Turn on; **Forget permissions** turns it off and removes its `extension-allow` lines too). A command runs off the main thread with the selection (notes drawer, browser pane, reading pane or editor), the open item and the screen. A **library** is a tab in the notes drawer ("Reading notes | Notes"; markdown-notes' tab shows once it's on, even with no folder, where it says so with **Choose a folder…**). markdown-notes' vaults get a switcher above it: a chip per vault (one not allowed yet in the warning colour, and choosing it shows "Burrow needs your permission…" with **Allow…**), **Add folder…** (the folder picker, several at once), and the chosen vault's folder with **Remove from Burrow** (drops its `vault…` line and its `fs:` grant; never touches the folder). The chosen vault is remembered (`state.json`, `notes_vault`). Under it: breadcrumbs, a search box (each keystroke searches again, only the newest answer shows; after 2 s "Notes didn't answer"), folders and notes; a note opens in an editor showing its body (frontmatter kept aside and written back unchanged), Save names the hash it was read at, and a refused save says "Changed on disk" and offers Reload or Keep mine as a new note. **Quote into post** / **Copy verbatim** put the selection, or the whole note, into the open draft at its caret (a new draft when none is open). The quote picker (⌘K) has a "notes" chip that searches every vault (with more than one, each row names its vault; a vault not allowed yet is skipped) and quotes the note as a `>` blockquote naming it, never `![[…]]`. Search, New note, Quote into post and Copy verbatim act on the chosen vault. Settings › Notes folders lists the vaults, each with Remove, and **Add folder…** (several at once) writes `extension = markdown-notes` and a `vault` (the first) or `vault-<label>` line per folder (comments kept), then the consent sheet asks for the new folders. Publishing calls `Host::item_published`.

## Naming

The app is **Burrow** ("Burrow is a blygger client"): the menus, the About
window, the window title, the bundle (`Burrow.app`) and the release assets
(`Burrow-<ver>-macos-universal.{zip,dmg}`). Up to 0.6.0 it was Blygger. The
rename is display-only. These keep the old name, because existing installs
depend on them: the bundle ID `org.blygger.desktop`, the Keychain service and
`blygger-ai.*` accounts, the data folder and `blygger.db`, the browser pane's
data store, `~/.config/blygger/config` and the `BLYGGER_*` variables, the
`blygger` binary (`CFBundleExecutable`) and CLI, the GPUI key contexts and
action namespaces (user keybinding configs may name them), and the crates.
"Blygger" and "blyg" still name the protocol and platform.

Releases also publish `Blygger-<ver>-macos-universal.zip` (and the version-less
`Blygger-macos-universal.zip`), holding the same signed bundle in a folder
named `Blygger.app`, because 0.6.0's updater accepts only that. An install
updated from 0.6.0 keeps its on-disk name `Blygger.app`.
