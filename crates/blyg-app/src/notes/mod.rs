//! --- notes --- The notes drawer (docs/SPEC.md § Notes drawer).
//!
//! A scratchpad that slides in over the right edge of the window while you
//! read (⇧⌘N, View › Notes): running notes, links to posts and pages, and
//! quoted selections, for writing better posts later. It never adds a layout
//! column: it's an overlay, and the web views it overlaps are cut off at its
//! edge (they draw above GPUI).
//!
//! It's backed by an ordinary scratch note (local only, in the Posts list
//! with its `scratch` pill; ⌘D makes it a draft). One rolling note titled
//! "Reading notes" by default, made a thread so `![[id]]` quotes are valid
//! in it; "New notes page" starts another and leaves the old one in Posts.
//!
//! - this file: the text the drawer appends (pure, unit-tested) and its state;
//! - `drawer`: the `MainView` hooks, the drawer itself and its demos.
