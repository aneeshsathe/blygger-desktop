//! Two classes of method:
//! - **Local** (no network, must return in well under a millisecond for a few
//!   thousand items): reads, `create_draft`, `save`, `set_kind`. Mutations
//!   write SQLite, enqueue an outbox op, and return. The sync worker pushes.
//! - **Remote** (blocking network call; the UI runs these on a background
//!   executor): publish, pin, withdraw, media, subscriptions, … They return the
