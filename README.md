# Burrow

**Burrow is a blygger client:** a native macOS studio for
[Blygger](https://blygger.org) blogs ("blygs"), built to be as fast as
Notational Velocity.

There's one window: type to search, press ⏎ to create, and nothing ever waits
on the network. Everything you write is saved on your Mac first and synced to
your blyg in the background. It's written in Rust with
[GPUI](https://www.gpui.rs), the UI framework behind Zed.

Burrow was called Blygger Desktop up to 0.6.0. See
[the rename](https://aneeshsathe.github.io/blygger-desktop/install.html#the-rename).

## Install

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aneeshsathe/blygger-desktop/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

This puts **Burrow.app** in `/Applications`, checked against the release's
signed checksums. Requires macOS 11 or later. Burrow then updates itself.
Other ways to install, and what to do when macOS blocks a browser download,
are in [the docs](https://aneeshsathe.github.io/blygger-desktop/install.html).

Burrow works with any blyg on blygger-studio 0.9 or later: sign in with your
studio password. A server with a few extra owner-API extensions gets a little
more ([server requirements](https://aneeshsathe.github.io/blygger-desktop/server.html)).
No blyg? Try it on the built-in sample data.
